A few months ago, I made my first data visualization in google data studio as task from Belajar Data Analysis. It's a sales dashboard. In this data analysis, I hope that it can provide an easily understandable overview of the KPI and allowing you to check in on progress toward sales goals and targets.

You can click the link below to see the dashboard.
