The dataset has 6 features with its charges (Individual medical costs billed by health insurance). It will be analyse the factor that effect to the amount of charges then can be used to determine the insurance cost. The following is the explanation of how features effect to the amount of charges:
* Age: age of primary beneficiary. The graph implies that the higher age charges relatively greater than the lower age charges.
* Sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male. The graph implies that male charges greater than female charges.
* Bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9. The graph implies that people who has bmi greater than 30 relatively get greater charges.
* Children: Number of children covered by health insurance or Number of dependents. The mean of charges based on patient's number of dependents implies that patient who has 5 children dependents gets less charges.
* Smoker: Smoking. The graph implies that smoker charges 4 times greater than no smoker charges.
